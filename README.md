## Synopsis

Plays typing writer sound after every hit.
You can replace the wav files to customize sound.

Its using MCI to play sounds and sadly the volume level is not controllable with wav files.
So if you want to lower the volume, change the wav itself.

TypeNoisyBuilt.zip contains the executable app.

## Motivation

I didn't find any app that does how i want.
Play the sounds simultaneously. Magic.

*Known issue when lot keys(8>) are pressed at the same time.*

## API Reference

Written in .NET Windows Forms to minimze memory footage.
As only a System Tray icon is shown.
